// 'Use strict' method

"use strict";
// this code works the modern way and must be on top
// once use strict is used we cannot return to default

// At this point in time it’s enough to know about it in general:

// 1. The "use strict" directive switches the engine to the “modern” mode, changing the behavior of some built-in features. We’ll see the details as we study.
// 2. The strict mode is enabled by "use strict" at the top. Also there are several language features like “classes” and “modules” that enable strict mode automatically.
// 3. The strict mode is supported by all modern browsers.
// 4. It’s always recommended to start scripts with "use strict". All examples in this tutorial assume so, unless (very rarely) specified otherwise.
